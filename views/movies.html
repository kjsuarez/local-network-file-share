            <p id="being-there-desc" class="description">Satire about a man who spends his whole life as a shut-in and then is made to live in the outside world. I still haven't seen it but it's on my list.</p> 
            <p id="dr-z-desc" class="description">This one is <i>Capital C</i> Cinema you guys. A story about how the good intentions of revolution are warped by the agony of living through that revolution.</p>
            <p id="hamlet-desc" class="description">Unabriged theatrical film version of Hamlet. I'm not a huge Shakespeare guy, but I really enjoyed it! It's cool to see a Hamlet line-read happening on location at like a legit castle. </p>
            <p id="kajil-desc" class="description">I haven't seen it but it looked really funny! You want to watch it with me?</p>
            <p id="end-world-desc" class="description">A film by the excellent Wim Wenders. Four and a half hours long! Still haven't seen it.</p>
            <p id="french-desc" class="description">A neo-noir considered by certain smarties-pants to be one of the best films ever made. I still haven't gotten around to it myself. ðŸ˜…</p>
            <p id="tng-desc" class="description">Aw Man. TNG is like a warm cup of tea in television form. Downright tranquil. I'm giving it a seperate page because each season has a seperate download and I didn't want to muddle this page any more than I already have.</p>
